You will need Linux to run the binaries (However these can be solved without running these binaries). This can be done by building then running the challenges in a docker container. Using the command in the parent directory:

`docker build -t re .`

then to run,

`docker run -it re`


You can also move these files to the instructional machines (eduroam or berkeleyVPN required!)
